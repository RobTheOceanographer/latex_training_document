\section{First things first: What is it and how do I install \LaTeX\ !!!}  
\subsection{What is it?}
I don’t want reinvent the wheel... here is the link to the wiki book.
\\ \url{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Introduction}

\subsection{How to install \LaTeX\ !!!}
I have re-invented the wheel for this one... sometimes you get a better wheel!

First of all, there are lots of different types of \LaTeX\  distributions.  To simplify your search process I will suggest you choose from the below(last updated , September, 3rd, 2011).  
\\ (I suggest following the instructions at this website if your having trouble with the install:
\\ \url{http://www.haptonstahl.org/latex/start_downloading.php})

\subsubsection{WINDOWS and LINUX users:} Download the latest version of Tex Live or MikTex (currently 2.8).  It should come with TeXWorks as the user interface.  \\ \url{http://docs.miktex.org/2.8/relnotes/}

\subsubsection{MAC users:}  Download the latest version of MacTeX.  This comes with TeXShop as the user interface (TeXWorks is unashamedly based on TeXShop.  TeXShop is older, and more developed, so at the moment is better. However, keep checking the net for comparisons.  If you plan to use multiple platforms (Mac, Linux and Windows, then use TeXWorks, so you only have to learn how to use one style).  \\ \url{http://www.tug.org/mactex/2009/}


\section{The absolute basics}
\subsection{How to create a document with ``hello world'' as the content~~} Go to this link \url{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQl2XdBiWNE&feature=related} \\  I suggest saving the first document you create into a folder on the desktop called ``MyFirstTexDocument''.  This is designed for TexShop but most of this is applicable to TexWorks too.

\section{How to make Figures and Tables}  
\LaTeX\ has a sensible, but very annoying, function that automatically locates your figures in the document where it believes is the best spot, NOT where you placed it in the text / code.    Sometimes getting the figure to be exactly where you want it in a long document is tricky.  However, because it does this, figures and tables are always located in the same relative positions throughout the entire document (e.g. top of the page) which gives the document a real sense of balance and continuity... It is still really annoying sometimes though...

To force \LaTeX\ to ignore this functionality sometimes, use either:\\
 \verb+ \begin{figure}[h] + where h=here\\
 or\\
 \verb+ \FloatBarrier + which forces all previous "floats" (figure or table environments) to be placed in the document before any of the following text / code.  


\begin{figure}[t] % I used `t' for top, instead of b=bottom, h=here or p=page of figures.  
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{50pinIsosurface0dbarAbsoluteSalintyWithFronts.png} %(NB:  if you have not got the figure in the same folder as your \LaTeX\  document, you will need to use the entire path name.)

\begin{color}{red}NB:  Note where this sentence is in the code, and where it is relative to all the figures in the document.  \LaTeX\  decides where figures work best, given the space available in the document.  \end{color}


\newpage %Put a percentage sign (%) at the start of this line, typeset the document again (once you have \LaTeX\  up and running) and see what happens... 
I have now forced a new page.  Look at  the code.  

\bigskip
Note where the table is in the code, and where it is in the document.  Tables and figures are called \emph{floats}, and so they are `floating' to the best position for the readers eye-flow while reading.  


\begin{table}[t]
\begin{threeparttable}[b] 
\caption{This is how you make a table.  }
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c}	%these are vertical lines (shift-backslash key) and the letter 'c' for centre alignment (alternatives are 'r' for right and 'l' for left).  
\toprule
&\multicolumn{3}{r}{\textbf{Multiple columns are done like this}} \\
\midrule
\multirow{5}{*}{\textbf{Multiple rows, like this}}& aardvark & bison & cat \\
&dog &emu &fish\\
&giraffe& horse &iguana\\

&&&\\
\textbf{Footnotes in tables}\tnote{1} & Are done & using the & \emph{threeparttable} package\tnote{2}, \tnote{3}\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\begin{tablenotes}
\item[1]  Footnotes in tables should be avoided.  Conventions for good table formatting is summarised in the \emph{booktabs} package, and I recommend you use that to produce your tables.
\item[2]  However sometimes they are necessary, and you need to use the\\ \emph{threeparttable} package for that.  
\item[3]  For tables with a lot of content, or that already exist in excel, I suggest investgating how to use the ``OpenOffice'' plugin called ``Calc2Latex''. This simplifies the construction and alteration of content in the latex code you need in a table.  
\end{tablenotes}
\end{center}
\label{howtomakeatable}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}%

%The main things to note are, to span multiple columns in a latex table you just use \multicolumn followed by the number of columns to span and how you want it positioned, e.g. l for left, r for right, c for centered. 
% Spanning multiple rows in a latex table is the same, except YOU NEED TO USE:  "\usepackage{multirow}" in the preamble (at the top), and using \multirow followed by the number of rows to span, and how you would like it positioned. * basically means best fit. Remember that the first element/column of each row needs to be empty, since you have some piece of information spanning multiple rows.





\section{Making lists (bullets points and the like...)}Below is a few examples of making lists... There are many more styles.    

\begin{itemize}
\item  Point 1
\item Point 2
\item Point 3
\begin{enumerate}
\item Point 3.1
\item another point 3.2
\item another 3.x
\begin{itemize}
\item Some extra 3.x.a
\item Some extra 3.x.1
\item Some extra 3.x.zebra
\end{itemize}
\item some more points
\item some more points

\section{How you do equations}
\subsection{Puting equations in the text~~}  This is how you do equations in a sentence using the Math environment:  $a=b+7c^2 - d_{testing} \times 15e^{2^{h}_i} \rightarrow 2f_{2\Delta}$.  

However, this equation is cut in half by the end of the line on the page.  So to force and `end of line', I will put in a `newline' command = \begin{verbatim} \\ \end{verbatim}  So that again is:  \\
This is how you do equations in a sentence using the Math environment: \\ $a=b+7c^2 - d_{testing} \times 15e^{2^{h}_i} \rightarrow 2f_{2\Delta}$ \\
\subsection{Numbering equations~~}  

This is how you give equations a number and a lot of space!!
\begin{equation}
\rho + \delta - \frac{345^{x^2 } + \theta \times \Omega_{x-1}}{rarely\ you\ may\ want\ (some\ written\ text\ \times \pi + \chi)}
\label{howtomakeanumberedequation}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Refer to your figures and tables in the text}  I will now reference the figures again.  I added a command inside each table or figure environment that was \begin{verbatim} \label{RandomNameForFigure} \end{verbatim}.  I now use \begin{verbatim} \ref{RandomNameForFigure}\end{verbatim} to refer to each figure, subfigure or table in the text.  

When used it look s like this:  So I refer to what is in table \ref{howtomakeatable}, and the figures \ref{justafigure} and \ref{twopicturefigure}, there are no subfigures.  However in figure \ref{subfigureexample} there are subfigures, such as \ref{sectionDAl}, and the rest...

\section{Which spell checker to use....}
Go online and find the most appropriate for your platform.  

\subsection{Suggested spell checker for Mac OSX}  I use a Mac, with OSX so I use CocoaSpell (its awesome).  It has a dictionary the includes all of the latex commands (like \begin{color}{blue}\textbackslash section\end{color}), which is really handy.  

\subsection{Suggested spell checker for Windows}  Unknown...

\subsection{Suggested spell checker for Linux}  If your using linux, you can probably figure out how to find the one that suits you best, based on the distribution and form of \LaTeX\  your using...

\section{How to cite references in \LaTeX\ }

This is how you cite references in latex.  It is very like using endnote, so if you know how to do that, find the referencing software for your platform (I suggest JabRef, operates on all platforms, very versatile, lots of functionality), install it, and use it!   \\

However, if you have never used any referencing software (THEN START!!!), you will need a little bit of learning to get it to work.  Its easy and straight forward, but outside of the scope of this tute.  If you need help ask me.  
\subsection{This is just a small example of how you reference sources.}
First person to suggest humans may effect climate was Fourier \cite{fourier1824}.  The first person to suggest CO$_2$ may trap a large amount of heat per molecule was Tyndall \cite{tyndall1861} (John Tyndall is a legend, if you havent heard of him, look it up on the net).  
Andy Bowie is my supervisor and he has written scientific papers \cite{bowie2002} \cite{bowie2007}.  
Thomas Trull is my old boss and he has also written some papers \cite{trull2008} \cite{trull2008a}.  
Juliette Tria did some work on her PhD, and her papers effectively explain what I was trying to do in mine \cite{tria2008a} \cite{tria2008b}.  
Stefane Blain was nice enough to put me on his paper after I participated in an oceanographic voyage from Reunion Island to Kerguelen Island \cite{blain2007}.
