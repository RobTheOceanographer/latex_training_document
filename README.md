# latex_training_document
Hi everyone!!

I hope this document and the attached documents give you enough so you won’t need a workshop, but I am happy to run a little training session for you and your friends if you feel you need one.
First of all, dont get scared by the code. I promise, it does make it easier than using word in the end. It is probably one of the easiest programs to start learning how to ‘code’, as it uses fairly intuitive commands. So learning how to use LaTeX makes using others programs heaps easier in the future. If you already have experience coding in another program, you will find this super easy!!
I have sent you a folder of documents. The two you are interested in are:
Latex training document.pdf (double click to open, as normal)
Latex training document.tex (select open with use TextEdit(mac), or WordPad(PC))
The rest are used to create the document, but you dont have to open them (but you can).
Look at the document and try and find the bits that are similar between the .tex and the .pdf. Alot of the comments on “how to do blah blah blah” are in the .tex document (comments are the bits that immediately follow a % sign), so make sure you read that too. The extra bits of code are telling the computer what fontsize, style, bold, indent, etc to use. In MS Word, you click on the “bold button to start using bold, and then click on it again to turn it off. In code you type something like:
 \begin{bold} A word or sentence you want to be bold.  \end{bold}
Its pretty easy to remember, its just that you have to learn the new commands. The beauty of it is, that you can see all the commands in the code, the code that YOU wrote, so it is easier to see why something isnt working, and how to fix it. Also the online help is awesome.
Okay, about the attached documents.

In the attachment you should have recieved:

isocratic vs gradient.eps (picture file)
latex training document bibliography.bib (bibliography library for this file, like an endnote library) latex training latex training document.tex (input file, or the code file, the one that looks ugly...)

The first time you format latex it will create these files:

latex training document.toc (file latex creates automatically when you want a table of contents)
document.aux (latex file used to produce the .pdf output)
latex training document.bbl (file latex creates automatically when you want a bibliography)
latex training document.blg (file latex creates automatically when you want a bibliography)
latex training document.lof (file latex creates automatically when you want a list of figures)
latex training document.log (log of every command latex uses, and the response of the program to each command, such as success or ERROR)
latex training document.lot (file latex creates automatically when you want a list of tables) latex training document.pdf (output file, the one that looks pretty)
latex training document.synctex.gz

Anyway, good luck deciphering my code.
I am keen for any constructive criticism of this document to improve it.

Cheers, TANK
